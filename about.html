                        <p>The story of Kagemori begins in 1914, with a small teahouse nestled deep within the forests of Kyoto. Founded by Haruto Mikage, the teahouse was a sanctuary for weary travellers seeking respite from their journeys. Surrounded by the serenity of nature, guests are able to connect with the beauty of the seasons and find peace beneath the towering trees. Haruto’s philosophy was deeply rooted in the belief that food should reflect nature’s harmony, crafted with care and served with warmth. Visitors often praised his ability to capture the forests’ essence in every dish, balancing light and shadow in flavours that felt both grounding and uplifting.</p>

                        <p>Over the decades, Kagemori’s legacy endured. In 2020, Kenji revitalized the family tradition, reimagining the teahouse as a modern restaurant. Inspired by the original spirit of Kagemori, he infused the space with natural elements like lush greenery and soft lighting. In 2024, Kenji expanded Kagemori’s vision beyond Japan, opening its first international location in Selangor, Malaysia. With the help of business partners Lee Yee Kang and Lim Soon Jie, the Malaysian branch retains the essence of the original Kyoto restaurant while incorporating local influences, creating a harmonious blend of cultures that honours both tradition and innovation.</p>
